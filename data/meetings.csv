Running lots of troubleshooting trying to figure out errors with new connectors"
2025-11-20,University of Alaska,Quick Dev Meeting with Michael,"Quick meeting on 2 new DIM Application tables, as well as fixing some of the problems with AO CODE
3 weeks to get the dims done, AO codes are the prority"
2025-11-25,General Non-client,Cert Tracker,"- Emails are 80% accurate?
- Wants amore dynamic staff ID finder
-Add NULL to blanks
-Need for staff to be able to make an update in the power BI using a separate form
-Need to have a technical document and user manual
-User guide should be 1-2 pages "

Make sure we are doing validated work flows
Get new git hub keys
 
Copy query from (hcai are more complicated and ned changes)
Swithc to teradate_JDBC_V2
Look for any parameters (cmd f on $param - test read souces or go into param files (only for testing)) - will change back
Check what the parm file is
Copy EXALTY
Reference a functional to review work - field names and Precision
Type, precision, and scale
Cmd f - as cdlxx field name - match case is slected updat to match th efield name -- replace all
 
Precsion and scal issue
Options - edit metadata - only precsion
Making edits to 0 doesn’t stick
Update query to find loophole - trick into getting precsion of 1 where '' as TO ' ' as - doble check every field name is changes AS
Don’t want unecessary saces in ed product- go to source edit query edit what we did with adding a=spaces - ' ' as -> replace all ''as then retian existing fields metadata
 
Once funcitons as expexted - switch hard coding to parameter
 
Target
Make sure formatting is correct I use PC
 
Target final is in final task in session log

keep native precision



QUESTIONS:
Should we be converting precision even if the precision is 0 on the old mappings?"
2025-12-10,General Non-client,Mike Lopez Cert Tracker,"- Full team tracker to comply with the  new update
-New tracking tab to get requirements by position - drill per staff to see what is still required
- Cost- want to know cost drilldowns by cert, staff, etc.
- Mike Gabe Alex Alex are L&D leads
- We will need those expirations
-  Will email mike on "

2025-12-29,University of Alaska,Cole Michael Sync,"- Transaction mappings all done and tested on my end, emailed lara
SSRFEES (Cole) 
Would like to put them in a tf
-Add to  tf running them nightly-no need to check for failures for now just put them all in there and link them. Dont need to get fancy
Look at IPUs for run looking at metering drilling down to CDI
- DIM_ADMIT
Updates made, would like to add more to the decode statement
-Would like to start next step of development with dim_student_level updates

Ask about the 'Other' Types

Testing
-STVADMT, STVAPDC : No Mapping Task
-STVADMT - Mapping trx_END_DATE and trx_ACR+TIVE INDICATOR

Over IPU usage is not an issue, we are running a lot in development and prod-okay to go over informatica is fine with it


-Freeze next monday
-wants to know if we can get the freeze done by monday? Reach out to Hunter for clarification

2026-01-15,FRSG,FRSG Kickoff,"- Not large contracts- $10,000 sprints on projects
-Time tracking needs to be daily and exact
-Private equity group is Bane Capital- manage frsg
-Road striping company-all they do is rumble strips and paint
-Matilian, snowflake, power BI
-Enviroment has been redesigned-lots of ERPs from operating companies
-FRSG has 9 divisions wwhich do additional aquisitions-all have their own softwares
-New aquisition yesterday want pulled into data warehouse

####BACKROUND####
-Onenote is  in the shared onenote-all notes should be in the onenote
-conceptual module is heigharchy
-entity is the branch, 100+ entities sourcing data-equivilant to a company
-Margin is often around 50% - why PE is in the space
Matrix is fct and dim tables
-Process flow-matilian moves things from source to ODS-snowflake is where the ODS lands, Drom there similar to alaska-STG,EDW.
-The PE buys a division and needs to know the state of the company, backlog, etc.
-They have financial analysts building models off the data
-Workflow diagram shows the source systems rebuilding equipment mart right now
-Logical model shows all source systems and tables-think mart design
-They are using transaction records to track records


###DEMO MATILIAN###
-When running a mapping looking thing you need to change the source query and change the company name, one of the passwords, and the user ID.
-SOURCE_DATA is the company code, NAT in the example

#######FRSG_DEV.ODS.SOURCE_METADATA is the table that has all the tables in it,  and data about the tables-Key Columns show the unique identifier being used to determien if a record is changing
-Load column list- in the case of a  wide table, there is a list of tables. if it is null it will be a star.
-last load is not a trx table it is just a record of the last time a table was loaded

-Tables are being truncated every night into RAW
-LD_COMANY_TABLE is the naming convention LD= Load, company is the 3 letter code
-ODS_COMPANY_table- is the naming convention.
-ODs works like trx tables in the Alaska system

-STG is where we start standardizing tables
- number of procedures is the number of stg tables * number of companies because they are all going into the DIM tables.
-procedures take the parameters we enter in the pipeline and then they put them into the query to load the tables.

STG procedures
-To create the procedures he is coppying the pss procedures and changing the naming conventions to NAT
-If the procedure is not drawing from an EDW table, it is independent. You need to start from the independent tables as the other ones will rely on EDW
-parent IDs in the location table might be different then the PE companies naming conventions

LD_COMAPNY_SODOCUMENT is all bills/income
LD_CONMPANY_PROJECTS effe3ctivly contracts table
LD_COMAPNY_LOCATION 
2 more - there are 5 important tables you need to move on

MEGAENTITYID is likely one you need to check the source alias for the company"

2026-02-10,Regression Clients,Regression Check In,"-For Breush Pagan test we need the residuals for the test so we are really runningit on the test dataset
-BP is meant to test on the results with a Null hypothesis that the data is homoskedastic, and that the residuals are evenly distributed. We test to determine if the variablitiy of the regression changes in a clear way based on the explanatory variables-so we need the test data to be what we are testing on.

-Breusch godfree is a test for autocoorelation, runs an auxillary regression on the data using the lagged residuals as predictors
-We are testing if the residuals can be predictors of future residuals- does the error yesterday effect the error today - is there some force that is causing your model to predict poorly multiple predictions in a row consistently
-Null hypothesis is that there is serial correlation

-Changing the regression loops so we are running the BP test on each MODEL because it is really a test of each models explanatory power.
-change the regression type - we were running an RLM model for the heteroskedasticity tests and the autocoorelation which doesnt make sense because of the OLS use in the main function"
2026-02-09,University of Alaska,Alaska Data Governance Touch Base,"Use maplets to determine if the pidms are in the bad table. 
Put the rules on the ODS table



Rules From Previous: 
###########RAW###########
SPRIDEN – Bad student IDs Raw
	Logic – ultimately we need to confirm that the SPRIDEN_ID is a 30M formatted number, you may do this differently in Informatica. I don’t think the Length of Spriden_ID is going to work as a catch all.
SELECT DISTINCT spriden_id
FROM test_raw.banner_student.spriden
WHERE spriden_change_ind IS NULL—indicates most recent record
  AND spriden_entity_ind = 'P'--Indicates a person
  AND LENGTH(spriden_id) = 8
  AND spriden_id BETWEEN '30000000' AND '39999999'
  order by 1;

GOBINTL – Student with multiple records (PIDMs). Low priority as this currently has no invalid records



############REFINED
o	ODS_STUDENT – Bad Student IDs Refined
	This rule should confirm that 0 bad IDs exist in out refined Zone. Threshold is 0.
o	ODS_ENROLLMENT
	Student without a home campus
•	MAU_CAMPUS is not null
	Student without a major code
•	MAU_MAJOR is not null
	Student without a degree code
•	MAU_DEGREE is not null
	Student without a student code level
•	STUDENT_LEVEL_CODE is not null
o	ODS_COURSE
	Course with an invalid session code
•	Session_code not in ('F', 'O', 'C', 'U', 'S')
