Running lots of troubleshooting trying to figure out errors with new connectors"
2025-11-20,University of Alaska,Quick Dev Meeting with Michael,"Quick meeting on 2 new DIM Application tables, as well as fixing some of the problems with AO CODE
3 weeks to get the dims done, AO codes are the prority"
2025-11-25,General Non-client,Cert Tracker,"- Emails are 80% accurate?
- Wants amore dynamic staff ID finder
-Add NULL to blanks
-Need for staff to be able to make an update in the power BI using a separate form
-Need to have a technical document and user manual
-User guide should be 1-2 pages "

Make sure we are doing validated work flows
Get new git hub keys
 
Copy query from (hcai are more complicated and ned changes)
Swithc to teradate_JDBC_V2
Look for any parameters (cmd f on $param - test read souces or go into param files (only for testing)) - will change back
Check what the parm file is
Copy EXALTY
Reference a functional to review work - field names and Precision
Type, precision, and scale
Cmd f - as cdlxx field name - match case is slected updat to match th efield name -- replace all
 
Precsion and scal issue
Options - edit metadata - only precsion
Making edits to 0 doesn’t stick
Update query to find loophole - trick into getting precsion of 1 where '' as TO ' ' as - doble check every field name is changes AS
Don’t want unecessary saces in ed product- go to source edit query edit what we did with adding a=spaces - ' ' as -> replace all ''as then retian existing fields metadata
 
Once funcitons as expexted - switch hard coding to parameter
 
Target
Make sure formatting is correct I use PC
 
Target final is in final task in session log

keep native precision



QUESTIONS:
Should we be converting precision even if the precision is 0 on the old mappings?"
2025-12-10,General Non-client,Mike Lopez Cert Tracker,"- Full team tracker to comply with the  new update
-New tracking tab to get requirements by position - drill per staff to see what is still required
- Cost- want to know cost drilldowns by cert, staff, etc.
- Mike Gabe Alex Alex are L&D leads
- We will need those expirations
-  Will email mike on "

Currently data is once per day refresh of Dung Beetle Report, it is on a 24 hour cycle, they are looking for a dynamic and immidiate data refresh
OR Cares? being launched soon
Ad Hoc-gotta find out what that means
Use Cases: quality checks, medicare enrollment over time, number eligible, group vs private policies, clients without insurance

2025-12-29,University of Alaska,Cole Michael Sync,"- Transaction mappings all done and tested on my end, emailed lara
SSRFEES (Cole) 
Would like to put them in a tf
-Add to  tf running them nightly-no need to check for failures for now just put them all in there and link them. Dont need to get fancy
Look at IPUs for run looking at metering drilling down to CDI
- DIM_ADMIT
Updates made, would like to add more to the decode statement
-Would like to start next step of development with dim_student_level updates

•	wf_TMSIS_Claims_RX_DD3_V1 
Need to do the precision check, ODBC holdup
•	wf_TMSIS_Claims_OT_DD3_V1
Need to change the downstream field names."
2026-01-05,University of Alaska,UA Develupment Client Touch Base,"Ask about DIM_ADMIT_TYPE

Testing
-STVADMT, STVAPDC : No Mapping Task
-STVADMT - Mappint trx_END_DATE and trx_ACR+TIVE INDICATOR

Over IPU usage is not an issue, we are running a lot in develupment and prod-okay to go over informatica is fine with it"
